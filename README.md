# npBarcode
Demultiplex the Nanopore barcoding data
### Introduction

npBarcode is a tool to facilitate real-time demultiplexing for Nanopore sequencing 
data. It was developed as part of [Japsa](https://github.com/mdcao/japsa) package where its source code and documentation reside.

### Quick installation guide

npBarcode includes command-line module *jsa.np.barcode* and also integrated into [npReader](https://github.com/mdcao/npReader).

One may refer to [Japsa documentation](http://japsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for instructions to install the packages of interest.

### Documentation

Detailed usage of npBarcode including setting up downstream analysis afterward will be updated in  http://japsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/jsa.np.barcode.html

General information of Japsa can be found on its [ReadTheDoc](http://japsa.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
